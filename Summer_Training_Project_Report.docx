CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

1.1 COMPANY PROFILE
EventEase Lite is a modern event booking and management platform developed as part of the summer internship at the School of Computer Science and Engineering. The project simulates a real-world SaaS product for event management companies, enabling users to book event services and providing administrators with powerful analytics and management tools.

1.2 OVERVIEW OF TRAINING DOMAIN
The training focused on full-stack web development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Emphasis was placed on building secure, scalable, and user-friendly web applications with modern UI/UX, RESTful APIs, and robust authentication.

1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT
- To design and implement a robust, user-friendly event booking platform.
- To provide both customers and admins with seamless, secure, and efficient workflows.
- To gain hands-on experience in full-stack development and modern web technologies.

CHAPTER 2: TRAINING OVERVIEW

2.1 TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED
- Frontend: React.js, TailwindCSS, Vite, Axios
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, bcryptjs
- Other: Git, GitHub, Postman, MongoDB Atlas

2.2 AREAS COVERED DURING TRAINING
- Frontend development (React, TailwindCSS)
- Backend API development (Express, MongoDB)
- Authentication and authorization (JWT, bcrypt)
- RESTful API design and testing
- UI/UX best practices and responsive design
- Deployment and documentation

2.3 DAILY/WEEKLY WORK SUMMARY
- Week 1: Project setup, requirements analysis, initial backend and database design. Created Mongoose models for User, Service, Booking, etc. Set up Express server and RESTful routes.
- Week 2: Frontend scaffolding with React and TailwindCSS. Implemented authentication (register/login) and protected routes. Developed service browsing and booking UI.
- Week 3: Built booking system with time slot selection and conflict checking. Developed admin dashboard with analytics (charts, stats). Implemented CRUD for services and bookings.
- Week 4: Added partner application module and admin review. Enhanced UI with gradients, glassmorphism, and animations. Wrote documentation and finalized the project.

CHAPTER 3: PROJECT DETAILS

3.1 TITLE OF THE PROJECT
EventEase Lite – Event Booking Platform

3.2 PROBLEM DEFINITION
To create a platform that allows users to browse, book, and manage event services, while providing admins with analytics and full control over services, bookings, and partner applications.

3.3 SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
- User registration, login, and profile management
- Service browsing, searching, and booking with time slot selection
- Admin dashboard with analytics, charts, and CRUD operations
- Secure, scalable, and responsive design
- Partner application and management

3.4 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
- Node.js v16+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

3.5 ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM

CHAPTER 4: IMPLEMENTATION

4.1 TOOLS USED
- Visual Studio Code (IDE)
- Postman (API testing)
- GitHub (version control)
- MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)

4.2 METHODOLOGY
Agile development with weekly sprints, regular code reviews, and iterative UI/UX improvements. Each feature was developed, tested, and refined before moving to the next.

4.3 MODULES / SCREENSHOTS
- User Authentication: [Insert Login Screen Screenshot with show/hide password button]
- Service Listing: [Insert Services Page Screenshot]
- Booking Form: [Insert Booking Form Screenshot]
- UPI QR Code Payment: [Insert Payment QR Page Screenshot]
- Refund Flow: [Insert Refund Request/Admin Refund Screenshot, showing yellow for requested, green for successful]
- Admin Dashboard: [Insert Admin Dashboard Screenshot]
- Partner Applications: [Insert Partner Applications Screenshot]
- 'Be Our Partner' Page: [Insert Partner Application Page Screenshot]
- Navigation: [Insert screenshot showing all navigation buttons/links working]
- Image Carousel: [Insert screenshot showing 5-second image transition]

4.4 CODE SNIPPETS
Booking Creation (Express Controller):
```
const booking = new Booking({
  userId: req.user._id,
  serviceId,
  name,
  mobile,
  date: bookingDate,
  durationHours,
  timeSlot
});
await booking.save();
```
Authentication Middleware:
```
const auth = async (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.header('Authorization')?.replace('Bearer ', '');
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ message: 'No token' });
  const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
  req.user = await User.findById(decoded.userId).select('-password');
  next();
};
```

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

5.1 OUTPUT / REPORT
The platform now supports seamless event service booking, UPI QR code payment (shown only after admin confirmation), refund requests and processing (fully functional for users after admin cancellation and payment), and partner onboarding (via a protected 'Be Our Partner' page). Refund status is clearly shown in MyBookings (yellow for requested, green for successful). All navigation buttons and hyperlinks (including 'Contact Us') are checked and work correctly. All image transitions are set to 5 seconds. Login/Signup pages now have show/hide password buttons for improved UX. All features were tested and validated. The admin dashboard provides real-time analytics, booking management, and refund processing. Revenue analytics now only include paid, non-refunded bookings.

5.2 CHALLENGES FACED
- Handling time slot conflicts and preventing double bookings
- Ensuring secure authentication and role-based access
- Achieving a responsive and modern UI across devices
- Integrating partner application workflow
- Implementing UPI QR code payment flow and payment status tracking
- Designing robust refund request and processing logic (including user-initiated refund requests after admin cancellation and payment, and clear status display)
- Ensuring correct revenue analytics with refunds and payment status
- Ensuring all navigation buttons and hyperlinks work correctly
- Providing consistent image transitions and improved UX (show/hide password)

5.3 LEARNINGS
- Full-stack MERN development and deployment
- Real-world project workflow and agile methodology
- Importance of UI/UX, security, and code documentation
- Implementing payment and refund flows in a real-world app (including user-initiated refund requests and status display)
- Managing protected routes and role-based access for business logic
- Ensuring all navigation and transitions are smooth and user-friendly

CHAPTER 6: CONCLUSION

6.1 SUMMARY
The internship provided hands-on experience in building a modern, scalable web application. The project met all objectives and now includes advanced business logic for payment, refunds, and partner onboarding. The platform is ready for further enhancements such as email notifications and mobile app support.
