CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

1.1 COMPANY PROFILE
EventEase Lite is a modern event booking and management platform developed as part of the summer internship at the School of Computer Science and Engineering. The project simulates a real-world SaaS product for event management companies, enabling users to book event services and providing administrators with powerful analytics and management tools.

1.2 OVERVIEW OF TRAINING DOMAIN
The training focused on full-stack web development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Emphasis was placed on building secure, scalable, and user-friendly web applications with modern UI/UX, RESTful APIs, and robust authentication.

1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT
- To design and implement a robust, user-friendly event booking platform.
- To provide both customers and admins with seamless, secure, and efficient workflows.
- To gain hands-on experience in full-stack development and modern web technologies.

CHAPTER 2: TRAINING OVERVIEW

2.1 TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED
- Frontend: React.js, TailwindCSS, Vite, Axios
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, bcryptjs
- Other: Git, GitHub, Postman, MongoDB Atlas

2.2 AREAS COVERED DURING TRAINING
- Frontend development (React, TailwindCSS)
- Backend API development (Express, MongoDB)
- Authentication and authorization (JWT, bcrypt)
- RESTful API design and testing
- UI/UX best practices and responsive design
- Deployment and documentation

2.3 DAILY/WEEKLY WORK SUMMARY
- Week 1: Project setup, requirements analysis, initial backend and database design. Created Mongoose models for User, Service, Booking, etc. Set up Express server and RESTful routes.
- Week 2: Frontend scaffolding with React and TailwindCSS. Implemented authentication (register/login) and protected routes. Developed service browsing and booking UI.
- Week 3: Built booking system with time slot selection and conflict checking. Developed admin dashboard with analytics (charts, stats). Implemented CRUD for services and bookings.
- Week 4: Added partner application module and admin review. Enhanced UI with gradients, glassmorphism, and animations. Wrote documentation and finalized the project.

CHAPTER 3: PROJECT DETAILS

3.1 TITLE OF THE PROJECT
EventEase Lite – Event Booking Platform

3.2 PROBLEM DEFINITION
To create a platform that allows users to browse, book, and manage event services, while providing admins with analytics and full control over services, bookings, and partner applications.

3.3 SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
- User registration, login, and profile management
- Service browsing, searching, and booking with time slot selection
- Admin dashboard with analytics, charts, and CRUD operations
- Secure, scalable, and responsive design
- Partner application and management

3.4 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
- Node.js v16+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

3.5 ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM

CHAPTER 4: IMPLEMENTATION

4.1 TOOLS USED
- Visual Studio Code (IDE)
- Postman (API testing)
- GitHub (version control)
- MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)

4.2 METHODOLOGY
Agile development with weekly sprints, regular code reviews, and iterative UI/UX improvements. Each feature was developed, tested, and refined before moving to the next.

4.3 MODULES / SCREENSHOTS
- User Authentication: [Insert Login Screen Screenshot]
- Service Listing: [Insert Services Page Screenshot]
- Booking Form: [Insert Booking Form Screenshot]
- Admin Dashboard: [Insert Admin Dashboard Screenshot]
- Partner Applications: [Insert Partner Applications Screenshot]

4.4 CODE SNIPPETS
Booking Creation (Express Controller):
```
const booking = new Booking({
  userId: req.user._id,
  serviceId,
  name,
  mobile,
  date: bookingDate,
  durationHours,
  timeSlot
});
await booking.save();
```
Authentication Middleware:
```
const auth = async (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.header('Authorization')?.replace('Bearer ', '');
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ message: 'No token' });
  const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
  req.user = await User.findById(decoded.userId).select('-password');
  next();
};
```
